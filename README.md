# Introduction:

R Shiny is a widely used package for the R programming language. Shiny is an open-source R package that offers an attractive and robust web framework for developing web applications using (Miller & Shalhout, 2022). With Shiny, you can easily transform your studies into dynamic web apps without needing to know any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. In the life sciences, R is very popular. Shiny can be utilized to make visually attractive dashboards. Shiny makes it simple to convert an analytical pipeline into an interactive web app.  Additionally, it is excellent for educating, visualizing, and communicating.

# R shiny apps and importance in different fields:

Determining novel therapeutic agents and creating medications require an understanding of the ability to predict correlations between cancer genomes and the reaction of cancer cells to anti-cancer therapies. Global consortia have utilized sequencing tools and drug-screening approaches to analyze the genetics of numerous pan-cancer cell lines and tumors (Wang et al., 2024). For example, consider the developed DeepDR. DeepDR is a simple implementation model mostly used to predict anti-cancer medication sensitivity. The model predicts a cancer sample's reaction to every drug in the GDSC library by integrating the gene mutation and expression patterns of the sample (Wang et al., 2024).  With the use of shinyDeepDR, users can input gene expression and/or mutation data from a cancer sample and accomplish two primary tasks, such as determining the drug and the sample (Wang et al., 2024). In conclusion, shinyDeepDR is a free-to-use web tool for in silico anti-cancer drug screening.
Another example is the R Shiny App GNOSIS (GeNomics explOrer using StatistIcal and Survival analysis in R), which combines several R programs allowing users to view genomic and clinical data (King et al., 2022). A wide range of functionalities, such as visualizations of data, statistical and survival analysis, and mutation research are supported by GNOSIS's graphical user interface (King et al., 2022). It makes research more replicable by making the R scripts and input logs downloadable. Therefore, it provides a great way to help clinician-researchers increase their proficiency with statistical computing.
While R Shiny has proven to be invaluable in the field of cancer research, its applications extend far beyond the biomedical domain. Interactive R shiny applications such as the Rossman-Chance collection, are popular tools for teaching statistics because they help illustrate fundamental concepts such as randomness, sampling, and variability through dynamic visualizations (Wang et al., 2021). It can also be used as part of in- or out-of-class assignments and as lecture/video supplements
